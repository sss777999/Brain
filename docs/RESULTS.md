| **CURRICULUM** | 49 | 50 | **98.0%** | Core knowledge tests |
| **STRICT** | 3 | 3 | **100.0%** | "I do not know" tests |
| **PRESCHOOL** | 46 | 48 | **95.8%** | Ages 3-6 knowledge |
| **GRADE1** | 64 | 64 | **100.0%** | Grade 1 world knowledge |

## Comparison with IR Baselines

All baselines trained on **identical data** (curriculum.py sentences + connections).

| Test | Brain | TF-IDF | BM25 | Brain vs TF-IDF | Brain vs BM25 |
|------|-------|--------|------|-----------------|---------------|
| CURRICULUM | **98.0%** | 58.0% | 48.0% | **+40.0%** | **+50.0%** |
| STRICT | **100.0%** | 33.3% | 33.3% | **+66.7%** | **+66.7%** |
| PRESCHOOL | **95.8%** | 22.9% | 22.9% | **+72.9%** | **+72.9%** |
| GRADE1 | **100.0%** | 39.1% | 37.5% | **+60.9%** | **+62.5%** |
| FINEWEB | **77.8%** | 0.0% | 0.0% | **+77.8%** | **+77.8%** |
| PARAPHRASE | **50.0%** | 38.0% | 38.0% | **+12.0%** | **+12.0%** |
| bAbI* | **100.0%** | N/A | N/A | MemNet: 100.0% | NTM: 88.4% |
| **AVERAGE (QA)** | **86.9%** | **31.9%** | **30.0%** | **+55.0%** | **+57.0%** |

*bAbI requires working memory — TF-IDF/BM25 cannot track entity movements. MemNet/NTM are working memory baselines.

### Key Findings

1. **Brain significantly outperforms simple IR methods** (+55-77%)
2. **Working memory (bAbI)** — Brain achieves 100%, baselines cannot handle context
3. **Paraphrase robustness** — 50% accuracy indicates room for improvement
4. **"I don't know" capability** — Brain correctly abstains on unknown queries
