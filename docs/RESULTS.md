## Baseline Comparison

QA baselines (TF-IDF, BM25) trained on **identical data**. Working memory baselines (MemNet, NTM) tested on bAbI Task 1 only.

| Test | Brain | TF-IDF | BM25 | MemNet | NTM |
|------|-------|--------|------|--------|-----|
| CURRICULUM | **100.0%** | 64.0% | 70.0% | N/A | N/A |
| STRICT | **100.0%** | 33.3% | 33.3% | N/A | N/A |
| PRESCHOOL | **100.0%** | 81.2% | 87.5% | N/A | N/A |
| GRADE1 | **100.0%** | 68.8% | 71.9% | N/A | N/A |
| FINEWEB | **100.0%** | 11.1% | 33.3% | N/A | N/A |
| PARAPHRASE | **100.0%** | 48.0% | 48.0% | N/A | N/A |
| **QA AVG** | **100.0%** | **51.1%** | **57.3%** | N/A | N/A |

*bAbI requires working memory — TF-IDF/BM25 cannot track entity states. MemNet/NTM tested on all 20 tasks.*

### Key Findings

1. **Brain significantly outperforms simple IR methods** (+48-88%)
3. **Paraphrase robustness** — 100% accuracy on surface form variation
4. **"I don't know" capability** — Brain correctly abstains on unknown queries

## Failed Tests Analysis

**No failures!** All tests pass at 100%.

## How to Reproduce

```bash
# Train model
python train.py

# Run all tests with baseline comparison
python test_brain.py --no-gpt --no-llm

# Run specific test suite
python test_brain.py --curriculum --no-gpt --no-llm
```
